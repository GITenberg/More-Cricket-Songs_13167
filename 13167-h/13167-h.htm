DEAR JOHN DENTON,

<p>Not long ago you reminded me that once, when you were a boy and I was
a schoolmaster, I was angry with you because you pouted all through a
lesson in arithmetic. Let bygones be bygones, and accept as a proof of
my continuing friendship the dedication of this little volume, in
which there are no other sums than those of the Telegraph.</p>

<p>Most sincerely yours,</p>

<p>NORMAN GALE.</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Here's to the lad with his useful Fifteen,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Here's to the Bowler that's thrifty,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Here's to the Bat who is Lord of the Green</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>With his frequent and thundering Fifty!</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Excuse me, Sweetheart, if I smear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>With wisdom learnt from ancient teachers,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now winter time once more is here,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>This grease upon your lengthy features!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Behaving thus, your loyal friend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>No whit encourages deception:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Believe me, Fairest, in the end</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>This oil will better your complexion.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 5em;'>Fairest, believe!</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Did you imagine in the bag</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>To sleep the sleep of Rip Van Winkle,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Removed from sunshine's golden flag</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>And duller daylight's smallest twinkle?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Well have you earned your rest; but yet,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Although disturbance seem uncivil,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unless your cheeks and chin be wet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>With oil, your beauteousness will shrivel.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 5em;'>Rarest, believe!</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Absorb, that, when for our delight</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>The May unpacks its lovely blossom,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With beaming face, with shoulders bright</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>You leave the bag's congenial bosom.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then shall the Lover and his Lass</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Walk out toward the pitch together,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, glorying in the shaven grass,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Tackle, with mutual faith, the leather.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 6em;'>Dearest, absorb!</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If ever there was a Golden Game</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>To brace the nerves, to cure repining,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To put the Dumps to flight and shame,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>It's Cricket when the sun is shining!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gentlemen, toss the foolscap by,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Gentlemen, change from books to leather!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Breathe your fill of the breeze from the hill,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Thanking Bliss for the great blue weather.</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If ever there was a bag could beat</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>The box possessed by Miss Pandora,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Tis that in which there cuddle neat</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>The tools to shape the flying Fourer.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gentlemen, watch the purple ball!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Gentlemen, keep your wits in tether!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Take your joy with the heart of a boy</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Under the dome of the big blue weather.</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If ever I feel my veins abound</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>With zealous blood more fit for Twenty,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Tis when upon the shaven ground</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Fair Fortune gives me runs in plenty.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gentlemen all, while sinews last,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Bat ye, bowl ye, friends together!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Play the play till the end of your day,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Mellowest mates in the big blue weather!</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But ever the ancient tale is told,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>And History (the jade!) repeated:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Time, who's never over-bowled,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>At last we find ourselves defeated.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gentlemen all, though stiff we be,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Youth comes along in finest feather,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Just as keen as we all have been</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Out on the turf in the great blue weather!</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There's ever the deathless solace left&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>To gaze at younger heroes smiting,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of neither grit nor hope bereft,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Up to the end for victory fighting.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gentlemen all, we taste delight,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Banished now from the stream and heather,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Calm and cool on an old camp-stool,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Watching the game in the big blue weather!</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If cursed by a son who declined to play cricket,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>(Supposing him sound and sufficient in thews,)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I'd larrup him well with the third of a wicket,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Selecting safe parts of his body to bruise.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In his mind such an urchin King Solomon had</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When he said, Spare the stump, and you bungle the lad!</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For what in the world is the use of a creature</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All flabbily bent on avoiding the Pitch?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who wanders about, with a sob in each feature,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Devising a headache, inventing a stitch?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There surely would be a quick end to my joy</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If possessed of that monster&mdash;the feminine boy!&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The feminine boy who declines upon croquet,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or halma, or spillikins (horrible sport!),</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or any amusement that's female and pokey,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And flatly objects to behave as he ought!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I know him of old. He is lazy and fat,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Instead of this Thing, fit for punishment drastic,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Give, Fortune, a son who is nimble and keen;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A bright-hearted sample of human elastic,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As fast as an antelope, supple and clean;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Far other than he in whose dimples there lodge</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Significant signs of inordinate stodge.</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ay, give me the lad who is eager and chubby,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A Stoddart in little, a hero in bud;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who'd think it a positive crime to grow tubby,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And dreams half the night he's a Steel or a Studd!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There's the youth for my fancy, all youngsters above&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The boy for my handshake, the lad for my love!</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I know that Bowler, dark and lean,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Who holds his tongue, and pegs away,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And never fails to come up keen,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>However hard and straight I play.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spinning and living, from his hand</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>The leather, full of venom, leaps;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How nicely are his changes planned,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>And what a lovely length he keeps!</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Because he pulls his brim so low,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>However earnestly one tries</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One never sees the darkling glow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>That must be nimble in his eyes.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The fellow's judgment never nods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>His watchful spirit never sleeps.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There was a clinking ball! Ye gods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Why, what a splendid length he keeps!</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At times he bowls an awkward ball</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>That in the queerest manner swerves,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And this delivery of them all</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Takes most elastic from my nerves:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>It comes, and all along my spine</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>A sense of desolation creeps;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till now the mastery is mine,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>But&mdash;what a killing length he keeps!</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That nearly passed me! That again</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Miraculously missed the bails!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Too good a sportsman to complain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>He never flags, he never stales.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Small wonder if his varied skill</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>So fine a harvest daily reaps,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For how he marries wit and will!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>And what a deadly length he keeps!</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before I tell of matches seen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>And heroes of the mighty slog!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While hussies play near mistletoe</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>The game of kiss-me-if-you-dare,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With scorn to know the Nation's game</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tell cricketers to take to rhymes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>And smash at once the cross-bar props.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'><i>When</i> sportsmen, tied to sport, refuse</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>To offer lead the loyal breast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To tramp for miles in bloody shoes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To smirch their souls, to crack their thews,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wish to soar above the ruck,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And cups and cuffs, for all but muffs,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Were just the code the nobles taught, Sir,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their jests were coarse, and swift their coursers,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their throats were hoarse and strong as hawsers;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And they would shout a loud refrain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The while they pricked across a plain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Observe this phrase just once again&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The while they pricked across a plain.</span><br />
<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then 'twas the sport of Arthur's Court</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To hammer friendly helms with zeal, Sir,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lo, sounding clear for all to hear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Tourney rang with lyres of steel, Sir!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These demigods of matchless story</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For Love laid on, laid on for Glory!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their horses flew like thunderbolts,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or cut a brace of demi-voltes.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Observe this phrase. The mettled colts</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Came cricket bats and beaver hats,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The stumps, the ball, the burst of cheers, Sir!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus horse-play broke on Time's rough breakers</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And gentler games were hero-makers.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Men ceased to crave for olden times,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose daily deeds were modern crimes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But guarded stumps, and wrote their rhymes,</span><br />

<p><b>Notes on Books.</b></p>

<p>In issuing a list of new and forthcoming publications, Mr. Alston
Rivers cannot but express his gratification at the spirit of fair play
which has enabled him to realise such a striking series of successes.
The primary business of a publisher is to discriminate, both as to
intrinsic literary merit, and with regard to what will hit the public
taste, a classical illustration of the difficulty in gauging the
latter being the rejection of &quot;John Inglesant&quot; by the late James Payn,
then &quot;reader&quot; for an eminent firm. While fully recognising the
remarkable gifts of the author Mr. Payn's hesitancy as to the book's
attractions got the better of his judgment; and with &quot;<i>The House of
Merrilees</i>&quot; it is now an open secret that very much the same point of
view was taken in more than one instance. Mr. Marshall's &quot;<i>Peter
Binney, Undergraduate</i>,&quot; had been and is still decidedly popular, but
his new book was more ambitious, possessing such a plot as to require
peculiarly delicate handling. Had it been handled in a way that
combined a really high literary standard with more stirring qualities?
The question requires no answer now, for the triumph which the
publisher at once foretold on reading the manuscript has been more
than attained, and &quot;<i>The House of Merrilees</i>&quot; is indisputably the
novel of the season. It has at the same time demonstrated to the
publishing trade that a sensational story does not labour under any
disadvantage by the abduction of literary style.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In a wholly different vein are &quot;<i>The Discipline of Christine</i>&quot; and
&quot;<i>The Unequal Yoke</i>,&quot; by Mrs. Barr&eacute; Goldie and Mrs. H.H. Penrose
respectively. In the former the ways and moods of childhood are
depicted in original and inimitable fashion, which makes it safe to
predict that the author will go far beyond her first effort as a
novelist. In &quot;<i>The Unequal Yoke</i>&quot; Mrs. Penrose has taken for her theme
the love story of a clergyman whose benefice is an Irish coast town,
and in whose flock prominence is attained by narrow zeal rather than
by amiability. He is really a good man, and is lucky enough, or the
reverse, to win the hand of a delightful young lady whose charms,
however, do not command the unanimous approval of the parishioners.
The possession of high musical attainments makes her temperament all
the more interesting, and accounts for the presence in so remote a
district of her German friend whose acute sense of the ridiculous
leads to such untoward results. It is hard to say whether the author's
talents are best evinced by her true pathos or by the delicate touches
of humour which pervade the book. Another commendable feature of the
novel is an alert skill in construction which stamps it as a
thoroughly artistic production.</p>

<br />

<p>Mr. Reginald Turner has already achieved such distinction as an author
of superior fiction (witness the success of his &quot;<i>Comedy of Progress</i>&quot;
and &quot;<i>Cynthia's Damages</i>,&quot;) that a cordial reception was assured for
his latest book &quot;<i>Peace on Earth</i>.&quot; It is a pathetic story that he has
to tell; of the sorrows of the outcast amid poverty, and the rage
against law and government provoked thereby; of the less obvious, but
equally poignant, griefs which smoulder beneath the surface of
&quot;comfortable circumstances.&quot; The plot is, in short, one that in the
hands of any other than a thorough man of the world, would fail
hopelessly, which makes Mr. Turner's complete and undoubted success
all the more meritorious.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>The Countermine</i>&quot; is the work of Mr. Arthur Wenlock, whose &quot;<i>As Down
of Thistle</i>&quot; showed considerable promise, though perhaps his subtle
vein of sardonic philosophy escaped due recognition. As its name
denotes, the interest in the new novel is largely military; in every
line the soldier, with his nice sense of honour, his virility, and his
direct methods, stands revealed. &quot;<i>The Countermine</i>&quot; is certainly a
most thrilling tale, and should raise the author to the front rank of
writers on &quot;Service&quot; topics. Of Mr. Thomas Cobb, whose reputation is
already firmly established, it is only necessary to say that in &quot;<i>The
Friendships of Veronica</i>&quot; his fertile and resourceful pen is at its
best if, indeed, his literary reputation has not been substantially
advanced.</p>

<p>The hustling methods of modernity possess undoubted possibilities for
humorous treatment, and no one has appreciated the fact more keenly
than the authors of &quot;Wisdom While you Wait.&quot; In this their latest work
the prospectus of the Napolio Syndicate forms a bowstring whence fly
shafts of satire that hit the mark every time.</p>

<br />

<p>It is one thing to be a famous writer; it is another to be widely
read. Maxim Gorky is at present included in both categories, though as
regards the second condition he had scarcely qualified prior to the
publication of &quot;<i>Creatures that once were Men</i>.&quot; It was a bold
venture, for all the former successes in shilling form were either
sensationally melodramatic or frankly farcical. Encouraged by the huge
demand for Maxim Gorky's book, Mr. Alston Rivers is publishing in the
same form (1/-nett, paper, and 1/6 cloth) &quot;<i>Publican and Serf</i>,&quot; by
Skitaletz, a Russian Author, who, while by no means behind Gorky in
point of realism, possesses in the opinion of some critics a still
greater measure of literary ability. Other items of Mr. Alston Rivers'
Shilling Library, which has prospered as only the result of the most
careful selection could prosper, are &quot;<i>Lovers in London</i>,&quot; by A.A.
Milne, brightest and most promising of the younger humorists, and
&quot;<i>The Loot of Cities</i>,&quot; by Mr. Arnold Bennett, the mere name of whom
is a sufficient guarantee of entertainment. As for general literature,
&quot;<i>The Soul of London</i>,&quot; by Ford Madox Hueffer, may be justly described
as worthy of a place in every library. The author in his introduction,
remarks that he has tried to make the book anything rather than
encyclop&aelig;dic, topographical, or arch&aelig;ological, and beyond that
somewhat negative phrase it is difficult to give any more complete
designation to the work. For the treatment of the subject is
altogether original, this attraction being intensified by the
particularly graceful style in which a remarkable gift of observation
finds expression.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
